\section{Introduction}
This story is about six friends who help an English filmmaker create a documentary about Indian freedom struggle. During filming, this group of friends learn about those before them and the importance of fighting for their rights. 

\section{Sholay}
In this Indian action/adventure, Thakur (Sanjeev Kumar) has hired two small-time criminals to do some dirty work for him that he cannot get the police to do. He is a retired police inspector and seeks revenge on a bandit and his gang for mutilating him, murdering his family, and terrorizing the poor of his region. Veeru and Jai are agreeable, and soon the gangleader, Gabbar, and his henchmen have reason to regret their previous behavior.
